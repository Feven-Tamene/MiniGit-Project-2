Hello, I am Eden Yirefu and this is my demo for the MiniGit project.

My role in the project was to implement the optional diff feature.

The command I created is:
    diff <commit1> <commit2>

It compares the content of two commit files and shows the line-by-line difference.

Let me show you an example...

[Screen recording showing terminal commands]

You can see that lines that were removed are marked with "-",
and new lines are marked with "+".

Thank you for watching!
